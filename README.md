The **MetaMIDI Toolkit** is a collection of Blueprints for Unreal Engine 5.4 to provide a more intuitive way to create adaptive music for Game Designers, while still carving out a large space for composition and customization by Game Composers.

You can **download** the Toolkit by clicking GitHubâ€™s Code button > Download Zip.

Please see the full manual in the _MetaMIDI_Toolkit-Additional_ folder.
